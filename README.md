#  Practice using local JSON files

## Instructions
* 1. In Company.swift, fill out the `Company` type with the appropriate property names and types, based on what you see in Company.json.

* 2. In ViewModel.swift, fill out the `getCompany() -> Company?` method. (i.e.: Decode JSON from the Company.json file into a `Company`.)

* 3. In ViewModel.swift, fill out the `getEmployees() -> [Employee]` method. (i.e.: Decode JSON from the Employees.json file into an `Array` of `Employee`s.)

* 4. Run your app in the Simulator to see if it successfully loads a Company and list of Employees.
